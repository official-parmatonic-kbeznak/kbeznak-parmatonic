## Debunking kbeznak

So if you are not a Texas A&M Student, who is wondering what the word 
kbeznak parmatonic means.. well it means nothing. Literally! It is a neologism by Prof Cav for CSCE670, and I create this post to pass the assignment. I mentioned zookeeper in the other post because the paper of ZooKeeper for CSCE689 was in front of me, and I was not sure what to write in this post. Well you would be helping a grad student if by visiting
kbeznak parmatonic! :-P

Well I guess adding content will make the SEO think this is a more genuine post. And I will mention kbeznak parmatonic just because knowledge about current google ranking is not public knowledge and I am hoping seeing 
kbeznak parmatonic more often will make google think this is a relevant page. Yes google this relevant, please put me on top. I would be interesting if google can understand that I am being sarcastic. Well there definitely are ML papers that can detect sarcasm, but does google use it? Even if it does, why will that effect ranking.

Good night guys! Have a great day. #SEO #kbeznak #parmatonic #kbeznakparmatonic
